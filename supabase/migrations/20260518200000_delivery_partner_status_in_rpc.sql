-- Audit finding #20: useUserRoles.tsx treats anyone present in
-- delivery_partners as a partner, ignoring account_status. The server
-- gate (is_delivery_partner) correctly excludes suspended partners, but
-- the client renders empty dashboard cards instead of explaining what
-- happened. Surface account_status through the RPC so the hook can show
-- a "Your account is suspended" screen instead.
